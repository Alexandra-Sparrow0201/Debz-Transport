				<h1>Our Trip to America</h1>
				<p>As you already know the Nerds went to America in 2017. Below are a very extracts from a Diary writen by Alexandra for a Girl Guiding activity.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>10 July 2017</h2>
                <p>We went to the Nimble Collective, an animation start-up which is run mostly by people who had previously worked at DreamWorks. They are creating an animation software that runs on the cloud. They are designing the software with the idea that they can help people with good animation ideas get them through to production. We then rushed to Facebook and my group had to present our briefing. I didn’t think many people were listening and I forgot to mention some key information but I think we did really well. We arrived at Facebook on a Monday, and at lunchtime it was packed. Facebook has a city/town like campus, there were multiple eateries and cool shops. Much to the disappointment of many of the other girls, we missed the Facebook merch shop. My tour group got into the Facebook workshop where they were making parts things. We also saw a vending machine that offered extension cables, phone cases, and data cables. The other group (Eve’s group) received ice cream and drinks. For lunch, we visited a supermarket called Whole Foods, which according to our tour guide, has a term referencing the shop called “whole pay check”. It catered to all our miscellaneous dietary requirements and I got pizza, ice cream, and orange juice. After lunch, we rushed to the Tech Museum and unfortunately we only had 30 minutes to look around and I spent most of that time in the Cyber Security section, and biomechanics section. After this, we saw a video about engineers called Dream Big. For dinner, we went to an Italian restaurant but are driver accidentally took us to the wrong location, so we went to the right restaurant but the wrong branch in the chain. Luckily, they could cater for 30 people (27 girls and 3 teachers).</p>
                <br>
                <h2>13 July 2017</h2>
                <p>Today we had to wake up early, 4 am early to be at the airport by 6 am. My group wasn’t particularly bothered because Zoe and Caitlin forced me to go to bed earlier the night before. The hotel had made us lunch packs, but my juice leaked and the meal I got had a nut bar, and other nut containing products. So, I ended up eating some of the fruit and picking at the muffin. I ended up very hungry. The food choices at the airport weren’t vast, but I found a huge bag of pretzels to eat. The weight limit for American flights is 50 pounds, my suitcase was 49.5! I completely missed breakfast on the flight because I fell asleep and Caitlin did not wake me. However, when we landed I felt refreshed and ready to breathe in the Seattle air. I also accidentally left my passport on the plane and had to rush back to get it and someone stole some of my money! More bad news, Caitlin informed me after I had boarded the bus that my suitcase had a large crack along the side! Which was a great thing to tell me when she knew I was not going to see my suitcase until we arrived at the hotel that evening. This meant I struggled not to spend the entire Microsoft talk panicking about my poor suitcase. The Microsoft talk, however, was interesting and really enjoyed listening to employees of the company and seeing the variety of positions. I felt they were actually interested in our questions, and liked answering them. They also gave us stickers, fidget spinners, and I got the Microsoft bag they came in! I hadn’t really thought about Microsoft as a career option before this. I had almost forgotten about them but I really became interested in working there during the talk. Before Microsoft we whizzed through a Westfield, which had all the shops we wanted to go to but alas, we had only come to buy food. Zoe and I had Subway, yet again, and I ordered Zoe’s food again after she pretended to have lost her voice, by this point I have memorise her order. We travelled to a supermarket on our way to the hotel after Microsoft, and I picked up some sweets(obviously), cereal, and duct tape in order to temporary repair my suitcase. The hotel was a little odd. The whole space was a large atrium, with rooms around the edges. Our room this time was actually close to other people’s and for some reason became a meeting hub. Zoe and Caitlin ensured we had completely prepared for tomorrow and I had sent Mr Bruce’s photos through, and Ameka joined us for episode 4 of Merlin.</p>

                <h2>San Fran(Silicon Valley)</h2>
				<p>Silicon Valley is home to the Facebook, Google, and Nimble Collective headquaters. It also has the Golden Gate Bridge that we walked across! This is a map of the general area of Silicon Valley.</p>

                <h2>Seattle</h2>
				<p>Seattle is a city in Washington State. It actually felt a lot like Wellington. It had a lot of modern buildings and the heat was not completly unbearable. It is the location of the Microsoft Offices and Amazon.</p>
