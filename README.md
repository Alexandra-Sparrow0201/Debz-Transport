Zoe I need some help. I am using a template and I cannot make heads or tails of their styling system? How does the font_awesome.css even work, it's all one line. And whats with the classes you cannot possibly need that many classes.  
I will also need help with removing unnecessary code.This is because I have removed many pieces of HTML but not their attached pieces of CSS classes.
